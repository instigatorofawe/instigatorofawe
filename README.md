I'm Ran Liu. I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University in 2021.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar with Dr. Patrick Purdon at Stanford University in the department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine. Our lab was formerly at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in the department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine. My dissertation was on the application of statistical and machine learning methods for decision support in critical care. Currently, I'm working on research in computational neuroscience and anesthsiology, on treatment optimization in anesthesia and pain management, and on the characterization of consciousness and disease states.

I am broadly interested in the application of dynamical systems modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods to problems in medicine. In particular, I am interested in brain function, consciousness, and cognition, and in the intersection of machine learning and model-based methods.
