I'm Ran Liu. I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University in 2021, and am a Postdoctoral Scholar with Dr. Patrick Purdon at Stanford University in the department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine. Our lab was formerly at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.



Currently, I'm working on building computational models for treatment optimization in anesthesia and pain management. My projects include causal inference of average and individual treatment effects in surgical pain management, interpretable prediction of surgical outcomes from billing codes for diagnoses and procedures using Transformers, and dynamical modeling of postoperative patient state evolution using state space models, neural ODE and other black-box sequence models, and gray-box methods combining mechanistic models with deep learning.
